  abstract = {A generalization of the local density approximation (LDA) method for systems with strong Coulomb correlations is described which gives a correct description of the Mott insulators. The LDA+U method takes into account orbital dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable parameters. When applied to the transition metal and rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller distortion as well as polaron formation.}

Semi-local density functional theory (DFT) fails to recover the flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and concave fractional spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and static correlation errors. We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but now demonstrate that, like other widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree-Fock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find an alternative strategy, we examine the shape of semi-local DFT deviations from the exact flat plane and we find this shape to be remarkably consistent across ions and molecules. We introduce the judiciously modified DFT (jmDFT) approach, wherein corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-order functional forms that fit the shape of semi-local DFT err...},

  abstract = {We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighborhood environments, and analyze their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.}

  abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is a standard tool in most branches of chemistry, but accuracies for many molecules are limited to 2-3 kcal ⋅ mol-1 with presently-available functionals. Ab initio methods, such as coupled-cluster, routinely produce much higher accuracy, but computational costs limit their application to small molecules. In this paper, we leverage machine learning to calculate coupled-cluster energies from DFT densities, reaching quantum chemical accuracy (errors below 1 kcal ⋅ mol-1) on test data. Moreover, density-based Δ-learning (learning only the correction to a standard DFT calculation, termed Δ-DFT ) significantly reduces the amount of training data required, particularly when molecular symmetries are included. The robustness of Δ-DFT is highlighted by correcting “on the fly” DFT-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of resorcinol (C6H4(OH)2) to obtain MD trajectories with coupled-cluster accuracy. We conclude, therefore, that Δ-DFT facilitates running gas-phase MD simulations with quantum chemical accuracy, even for strained geometries and conformer changes where standard DFT fails.},

At variance with functionals of the total density, orbital-density-dependent functionals are typically not invariant with respect to unitary transformations of the occupied states. Such additional degrees of freedom require an extension of established approaches for direct minimization that preserve their numerical robustness and efficiency, and make it possible to apply these advanced electronic-structure functionals to large or complex systems. In this work we adapt the ensemble-DFT algorithm [N. Marzari, D. Vanderbilt, and M. C. Payne, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 1337 (1997)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.79.1337] to the case of orbital-density-dependent functionals, partitioning the variational problem into a nested loop of (i) minimizations with respect to unitary transformations at a fixed orbital manifold, that lead to a projected, unitary-covariant functional of the orbitals only that enforces the Pederson condition and (ii) variational optimization of the orbital manifold for this projected functional. We discuss in detail both general and functional-dependent trends and suggest a procedure to efficiently exploit the combination of the different minimization strategies. The overall formulation allows for a stable, robust, and efficient algorithm, yielding great improvements over conventional techniques.}

This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process. Learning density models now allows the construction of accurate density functionals for realistic molecular systems.},

  abstract = {DFT + U is a widely used treatment in the density functional theory (DFT) to deal with correlated materials that contain open-shell elements, whereby the quantitative and sometimes even qualitative failures of local and semi-local approximations can be corrected without much computational overhead. However, finding appropriate U parameters for a given system and structure is non-trivial and computationally intensive, because the U value has generally a strong chemical and structural dependence. In this work, we address this issue by building a machine learning (ML) model that enables the prediction of material- and structure-specific U values at nearly no computational cost. Using Mn–O system as an example, the ML model is trained by calibrating DFT + U electronic structures with the hybrid functional results of more than 3000 structures. The model allows us to determine an accurate U value (MAE = 0.128 eV, R 2 = 0.97) for any given Mn–O structure. Further analysis reveals that M–O bond lengths are key local structural properties in determining the U value. This approach of the ML U model is universally applicable, to significantly expand and solidify the use of the DFT + U method.},

Key exact results, for example, the equivalence between the infamous derivative discontinuity problem and the description of weight dependencies in the ensemble exchange-correlation density functional, are highlighted. The variational evaluation of orbital-dependent ensemble Hartree-exchange (Hx) energies is discussed in detail. We show in passing that state-averaging individual exact Hx energies can lead to severe (although solvable) v-representability issues. Finally, we explore the possibility of using the concept of density-driven correlation, which has been introduced recently and does not exist in regular ground-state DFT, for improving state-of-the-art correlation density-functional approximations for ensembles.

In this context, a relevant question is whether machine learning (ML) should be applied directly to predict the desired properties or combined explicitly with physically grounded operations. We present an example of an integrated modeling approach in which a symmetry-adapted ML model of an effective Hamiltonian is trained to reproduce electronic excitations from a quantum-mechanical calculation. The resulting model can make predictions for molecules that are much larger and more complex than those on which it is trained and allows for dramatic computational savings by indirectly targeting the outputs of well-converged calculations while using a parametrization corresponding to a minimal atom-centered basis. These results emphasize the merits of intertwining data-driven techniques with physical approximations, improving the transferability and interpretability of ML models without affecting their accuracy and computational efficiency and providing a blueprint for developing ML-augmented electronic-structure methods.}

B, 2010, 82, 115121] is apt for describing donor and acceptor levels for a wide variety of organic molecules, clusters, and oligomers within a few tenths of an electron-volt relative to experiment, which is comparable to the predictive performance of many-body perturbation theory methods at a fraction of the computational cost. © the Owner Societies 2013.}

  abstract = {Density-functional theory is an extremely powerful and widely used tool for quantum simulations. It reformulates the electronic-structure problem into a functional minimization with respect to the charge density of interacting electrons in an external potential. While exact in principle, it is approximate in practice, and even in its exact form it is meant to reproduce correctly only the total energy and its derivatives, such as forces, phonons, or dielectric properties. Quasiparticle levels are outside the scope of the theory, with the exception of the highest occupied state, since this is given by the derivative of the energy with respect to the number of electrons. A fundamental property of the exact energy functional is that of piecewise linearity at fractional occupations in between integer fillings, but common approximations do not follow such piecewise behavior, leading to a discrepancy between total and partial electron removal energies. Since the former are typically well described, and the latter provide, via Janak’s theorem, orbital energies, this discrepancy leads to a poor comparison between predicted and measured spectroscopic properties. We illustrate here the powerful consequences that arise from imposing the constraint of piecewise linearity to the total energy functional, leading to the emergence of orbital-density-dependent functionals that (1) closely satisfy a generalized Koopmans condition and (2) are able to describe with great accuracy spectroscopic properties.},

  abstract = {Obtaining a precise theoretical description of the spectral properties of liquid water poses challenges for both molecular dynamics (MD) and electronic structure methods. The lower computational cost of the Koopmans-compliant functionals with respect to Green's function methods allows the simulations of many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections method (QSGW + fxc). Thus, we explore water spectral properties when different MD approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and including nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that different MD approaches lead to up to 1 eV change in the average band gap; thus, we focused on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties of a system to explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to variations in the intramolecular O–H bond distance and HOH angle, as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bond O⋅⋅⋅O distance and the OHO angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution comes from the O–H bond length; the O⋅⋅⋅O distance plays a secondary role, and the other geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we analyze the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows good agreement with the DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections. The O–H bond length also significantly influences the DOS. When nuclear quantum effects are considered, broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the O–H bond lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra.}

As input, BSE calculations require single-particle states, quasiparticle energy levels, and the screened Coulomb interaction, which are typically obtained with many-body perturbation theory, whose cost limits the scope of possible applications. This work tries to address this practical limitation, instead deriving spectral energies from Koopmans-compliant functionals and introducing a new methodology for handling the screened Coulomb interaction. The explicit calculation of the W matrix is bypassed via a direct minimization scheme applied on top of a maximally localized Wannier function basis. We validate and benchmark this approach by computing the low-lying excited states of the molecules in Thiel’s set and the optical absorption spectrum of a C60 fullerene. The results show the same trends as quantum chemical methods and are in excellent agreement with previous simulations carried out at the time-dependent density functional theory or G0W0-BSE level. Conveniently, the new framework reduces the parameter space controlling the accuracy of the calculation, thereby simplifying the simulation of charge-neutral excitations, offering the potential to expand the applicability of first-principles spectroscopies to larger systems of applied interest.}

  abstract = {Hybrid functionals have proven to be of immense practical value in density-functional-theory calculations. While they are often thought to be a heuristic construct, it has been established that this is in fact not the case. Here, we present a rigorous and formally exact analysis of generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) density-functional theory of hybrid functionals, in which exact remainder exchange-correlation potentials combine with a fraction of Fock exchange to produce the correct ground-state density. First, we extend formal GKS theory by proving a generalized adiabatic connection theorem. We then use this extension to derive two different definitions for a rigorous distinction between multiplicative exchange and correlation components—one new and one previously postulated. We examine their density-scaling behavior and discuss their similarities and differences. We then present a new algorithm for obtaining exact GKS potentials by inversion of accurate reference electron densities and employ this algorithm to obtain exact potentials for simple atoms and ions. We establish that an equivalent description of the many-electron problem is indeed obtained with any arbitrary global fraction of Fock exchange, and we rationalize the Fock-fraction dependence of the computed remainder exchange-correlation potentials in terms of the new formal theory. Finally, we use the exact theoretical framework and numerical results to shed light on the exchange-correlation potential used in approximate hybrid functional calculations and to assess the consequences of different choices of fractional exchange.}

The learning quality improves significantly for the CNN (RMSE = 0.23 eV) and reaches its best performance for the DTNN (RMSE = 0.19 eV).

In our atomic calculations, the SIC-LDA yields total energies, ionization energies, and charge densities that are superior to results obtained with the local density approximation (LDA). However, for molecules, SIC-LDA gives bond lengths and reaction energies that are inferior to those obtained from LDA. The nonlocal Beck-Lee-Yang-Parr functional, which we include as a representative generalized gradient approximation functional, outperforms both LDA and SIC-LDA for all ground-state properties we considered.}

Applications are shown for various hydrocarbon molecules of increasing complexity and flexibility, and demonstrate the accuracy of the model when predicting the density on octane and octatetraene after training exclusively on butane and butadiene.

The residual self-interaction pushes the orbital energy levels upward. This effect is especially serious for valence states of insulators with localized charge distribution and causes an underestimation of the energy band gap. We have corrected for this incomplete cancellation of self-interaction in the density-functional formalism of energy-band theory of crystalline solids. The self-interaction correction (SIC) to the total energy of the N-electron system is expressed in terms of the Wannier functions, and periodic SIC potentials for the Bloch-state wave functions are derived variationally from the energy functional. The resulting SIC one-electron Hamiltonians are state dependent, but a unified Hamiltonian has been devised so that energies of all levels of the same →k from different bands are obtained by diagonalizing the same matrix. We have applied this SIC method to calculate the energy band structure of the argon and LiCl crystals. Using the Kohn-Sham exchange along with the correlation potential of von Barth and Hedin, we obtain band gaps in excellent agreement with experiment, whereas without SIC the calculated band gaps are more than 35\% below the experimental values.}

  abstract = {Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) demonstrate an exceptional combination of properties. Rapid progress has extended their application beyond solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and lasers to include memristors, artificial synapse devices, and pressure induced emission. In particular, the vacancy-ordered double perovskite Cs2TiBr6 has been identified as a promising material. The effective characterization of MHPs requires accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of electronic structure. Koopmans compliant (KC) functionals are an accurate and computationally efficient alternative to many-body perturbation theory using the GW approximation but have yet only been validated on a small number of simple materials. In this work, KC functionals were applied to the more complex case of Cs2TiBr6 and gave a zero-temperature fundamental gap of 4.28 eV, in close agreement with the value of 4.44 eV obtained using the accurate, but more computationally expensive, evGW0 approach. The temperature-dependent renormalization of the bandgap has also been investigated and found to be significant. Agreement with the experimental optical bandgaps of 1.76–2.0 eV would also require the inclusion of exciton binding energy.}

  abstract = {Excitation gaps are of considerable significance in electronic structure theory. Two different gaps are of particular interest. The fundamental gap is defined by charged excitations, as the difference between the first ionization potential and the first electron affinity. The optical gap is defined by a neutral excitation, as the difference between the energies of the lowest dipole-allowed excited state and the ground state. Within many-body perturbation theory, the fundamental gap is the difference between the corresponding lowest quasi-hole and quasi-electron excitation energies, and the optical gap is addressed by including the interaction between a quasi-electron and a quasi-hole. A long-standing challenge has been the attainment of a similar description within density functional theory (DFT), with much debate on whether this is an achievable goal even in principle. Recently, we have constructed and applied a new approach to this problem. Anchored in the rigorous theoretical framework of the generalized Kohn–Sham equation, our method is based on a range-split hybrid functional that uses exact long-range exchange. Its main novel feature is that the range-splitting parameter is not a universal constant but rather is determined from first principles, per system, based on satisfaction of the ionization potential theorem. For finite-sized objects, this DFT approach mimics successfully, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the quasi-particle picture of many-body theory. Specifically, it allows for the extraction of both the fundamental and the optical gap from one underlying functional, based on the HOMO–LUMO gap of a ground-state DFT calculation and the lowest excitation energy of a linear-response time-dependent DFT calculation, respectively. In particular, it produces the correct optical gap for the difficult case of charge-transfer and charge-transfer-like scenarios, where conventional functionals are known to fail. In this perspective, we overview the formal and practical challenges associated with gap calculations, explain our new approach and how it overcomes previous difficulties, and survey its application to a variety of systems.}

Our novel scheme is applicable to various mainstream density functional approximations. It substantially reduces the delocalization error, as exemplified by the significantly improved description of dissociating molecules, transition-state species, and charge-transfer systems. The usefulness of our novel scheme affirms that the explicit treatment of fractional electron distributions is essentially important for reducing the intrinsic delocalization error associated with approximate density functionals.}

However, its instable structure (perovskite black phase can transform to non-perovskite yellow phase at room temperature) limits further development. Since the first report in 2014, much efforts have been made to stabilize the structure (black phase), and the corresponding inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made great progress in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) which increased from 0.09\% to 19.03\%. In this review, we summarize the intrinsical instability of CsPbI3, and discuss the recent works in improving the stability of CsPbI3 from four aspects: (1) ionic incorporation; (2) metastable phases; (3) reduced dimensions; (4) steric hindrance. Finally, the problems that still exist and the possible directions for solving them are presented.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory offers accurate structure prediction at acceptable computational cost, but commonly used approximations suffer from delocalization error; this results in inaccurate predictions of quantities such as energy band gaps of finite and bulk systems, energy level alignments, and electron distributions at interfaces. The localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) was developed to correct delocalization error by using orbitals localized in space and energy. These localized orbitals span both the occupied and unoccupied spaces and can have fractional occupations in order to correct both the total energy and the one-electron energy eigenvalues. We extend the LOSC method to periodic systems, in which the localized orbitals employed are dually localized Wannier functions. In light of the effect of the bulk environment on the electrostatic interaction between localized orbitals, we modify the LOSC energy correction to include a screened Coulomb kernel. For a test set of semiconductors and large-gap insulators, we show that the screened LOSC method consistently improves the band gap compared to the parent density functional approximation.}

Conditions for the absolute convergence of the total energy in periodic boundary conditions are obtained, and their implications for calculations of the properties of polarized solids under the zero-field assumption are discussed. For aperiodic systems the exact electrostatic energy functional in periodic boundary conditions is obtained. The convergence in such systems is considered in the limit of large supercells, where, in the gas phase, the computational effort is proportional to the volume. It is shown that for neutral localized aperiodic systems in either the gas or condensed phases, the energy can always be made to converge as O(L−5) where L is the linear dimension of the supercell. For charged systems, convergence at this rate can be achieved after adding correction terms to the energy to account for spurious interactions induced by the periodic boundary conditions. These terms are derived exactly for the gas phase and heuristically for the condensed phase.}

Here, we develop noncollinear Koopmans-compliant functionals based on Wannier functions and density-functional perturbation theory, targeting accurate spectral properties in the quasiparticle approximation. Our noncollinear Koopmans-compliant theory involves functionals of four-component orbital densities that can be obtained from the charge and spin-vector densities of Wannier functions. We validate our approach on four emblematic nonmagnetic and magnetic semiconductors where the effect of spin-orbit coupling goes from small to very large: the III-IV semiconductor GaAs, the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe2, the cubic perovskite CsPbBr3, and the ferromagnetic semiconductor CrI3. The predicted band gaps are comparable in accuracy to state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory and include spin-dependent interactions and screening effects that are missing in standard diagrammatic approaches based on the random phase approximation. While the inclusion of orbital- and spin-dependent interactions in many-body perturbation theory requires self-screening or vertex corrections, they emerge naturally in the Koopmans-functionals framework.}

However, the application of LOSC to DFAs was mainly through a post self-consistent field (SCF) manner, and few results from applying LOSC to DFAs in an SCF manner have been reported. The reason is that the originally proposed SCF approach to SCF−LOSC calculation uses an approximate Hamiltonian and encounters convergence problems easily in practice. In this work, we develop a new SCF approach with a correct Hamiltonian and achieve reliable SCF−LOSC calculations. We demonstrate the capability of the new SCF approach for SCF−LOSC to correctly describe the electron densities, total energies, and energy-level alignment for the molecular dissociation process, while conventional DFAs or LOSC−DFAs with post-SCF calculations show large errors. This work demonstrates that the new SCF approach for SCF−LOSC would be a promising method for studying problems for correct electron densities and energy-level alignments in large systems.},

Recent efforts to reduce these interfacial defects have focused mainly on surface passivation4-6. However, passivating the perovskite surface that interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult, because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film. Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a coherent interface could be formed between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the formation of an interlayer between a SnO2 electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by coupling Cl-bonded SnO2 with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features, which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers.},

A theory able to compute from first principles these properties, accounting for the anharmonicity and quantum fluctuations in the nuclear energy landscape that can be implemented in systems with hundreds of atoms is missing. Here, we derive an approximate theory for the quantum time evolution of lattice vibrations at finite temperature. This theory introduces the time dynamics in the self-consistent harmonic approximation (SCHA) and shares with the static case the same computational cost. It is nonempirical, as pure states evolve according to the Dirac least action principle and the dynamics of the thermal ensemble conserves both energy and entropy. The static SCHA is recovered as a stationary solution of the dynamical equations. We apply perturbation theory around the static SCHA solution and derive an algorithm to compute efficiently quantum dynamical response functions. Thanks to this new algorithm, we have access to the response function of any general external time-dependent perturbation, enabling the simulation of phonon spectra without following any perturbative expansion of the nuclear potential or empirical methods. We benchmark the algorithm on the IR and Raman spectroscopy of high-pressure hydrogen phase III, with a simulation cell of 96 atoms. Our work also explores the nonlinear regime of the dynamical nuclear motion, providing a paradigm to simulate the interaction with intense or multiple probes, as in pump-probe spectroscopy, or chemical reactions involving light atoms, as the proton transfer in biomolecules.}

  abstract = {The need to interpret ultraviolet photoemission data strongly motivates the refinement of first-principles techniques that are able to accurately predict spectral properties. In this work, we employ Koopmans-compliant functionals, constructed to enforce piecewise linearity in approximate density functionals, to calculate the structural and electronic properties of DNA and RNA nucleobases. Our results show that not only ionization potentials and electron affinities are accurately predicted with mean absolute errors of \textbackslash textless0.1 eV, but also that calculated photoemission spectra are in excellent agreement with experimental ultraviolet photoemission spectra. In particular, the role and contribution of different tautomers to the photoemission spectra are highlighted and discussed in detail. The structural properties of nucleobases are also investigated, showing an improved description with respect to local and semilocal density-functional theory. Methodologically, our results further consolidate the role of Koopmans-compliant functionals in providing, through orbital-density-dependent potentials, accurate electronic and spectral properties.}

  abstract = {Dyson orbitals, their electron-binding energies, and probability factors provide descriptions of electrons in molecules that are experimentally verifiable and that generalize qualitatively useful concepts of uncorrelated, molecular-orbital theory to the exact limit of Schrödinger’s time-independent equation. Dyson orbitals are defined as overlaps between initial, N-electron states and final states with N ± 1 electrons and therefore are useful in the prediction and interpretation of many kinds of spectroscopic and scattering experiments. They also are characteristic of N-electron initial states and may be used to construct electron densities, one-electron properties, and total energies with correlated Aufbau procedures that include probability factors between zero and unity. Relationships with natural orbitals, Kohn–Sham orbitals, and Hartree–Fock orbitals facilitate insights into the descriptive capabilities of Dyson orbitals. Electron-propagator approximations that employ the Dyson quasiparticle equation or super-operator secular equations enable direct determination of Dyson orbitals and obviate the need for many-electron wavefunctions of initial or final states. Numerical comparisons of the amplitudes and probability factors of Dyson orbitals calculated with several self-energy approximations reveal the effects of electron correlation on these uniquely defined, one-electron wavefunctions.}

We discuss the properties and performance of most available density matrix functionals. Progress in the development of functionals has been paralleled by formulation of novel RDMFT-based methods for predicting properties of molecular systems and solids. We give an overview of these methods. The time-dependent extension, TD-RDMFT, is a relatively new theory still awaiting practical and generally useful functionals which would work within the adiabatic approximation. In this chapter we concentrate on the formulation of TD-RDMFT response equations and various adiabatic approximations. None of the adiabatic approximations is fully satisfactory, so we also discuss a phase-dependent extension to TD-RDMFT employing the concept of phase-including-natural-spinorbitals (PINOs). We focus on applications of the linear response formulations to two-electron systems, for which the (almost) exact functional is known.},

Ultimately, data-driven strategies which include data mining, screening, and machine learning techniques, employ the data generated.

This can render different models indistinguishable although their performance differs substantially across materials, or it can make a model appear generally insufficient while it actually works well in specific sub-domains. Here, we present a method, based on subgroup discovery, for detecting domains of applicability (DA) of models within a materials class. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing three state-of-the-art ML models for predicting the formation energy of transparent conducting oxides. We find that, despite having a mutually indistinguishable and unsatisfactory average error, the models have DAs with distinctive features and notably improved performance.},

It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled \$d\$ and \$f\$ electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site \$U\$ and inter-site \$V\$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 11 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3\% and 5\% for Hubbard \$U\$ and \$V\$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.},

  abstract = {First-principles calculations in crystalline structures are often performed with a planewave basis set. To make the number of basis functions tractable two approximations are usually introduced: core electrons are frozen and the diverging Coulomb potential near the nucleus is replaced by a smoother expression. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was the first successful method to apply these approximations in a fully ab initio way. Later on, more efficient and more exact approaches were developed based on the ultrasoft and the projector augmented wave formalisms. These formalisms are however more complex and developing new features in these frameworks is usually more difficult than in the norm-conserving framework. Most of the existing tables of norm-conserving pseudopotentials, generated long ago, do not include the latest developments, are not systematically tested or are not designed primarily for high precision. In this paper, we present our PseudoDojo framework for developing and testing full tables of pseudopotentials, and demonstrate it with a new table generated with the ONCVPSP approach. The PseudoDojo is an open source project, building on the AbiPy package, for developing and systematically testing pseudopotentials. At present it contains 7 different batteries of tests executed with ABINIT, which are performed as a function of the energy cutoff. The results of these tests are then used to provide hints for the energy cutoff for actual production calculations. Our final set contains 141 pseudopotentials split into a standard and a stringent accuracy table. In total around 70,000 calculations were performed to test the pseudopotentials. The process of developing the final table led to new insights into the effects of both the core-valence partitioning and the non-linear core corrections on the stability, convergence, and transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The PseudoDojo hence provides a set of pseudopotentials and general purpose tools for further testing and development, focusing on highly accurate calculations and their use in the development of ab initio packages. The pseudopotential files are available on the PseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org under the name NC (ONCVPSP) v0.4 in the psp8, UPF2, and PSML 1.1 formats. The webinterface also provides the inputs, which are compatible with the 3.3.1 and higher versions of ONCVPSP. All tests have been performed with ABINIT 8.4.},

Several exchange-correlation functionals were tested. IPs and EAs were obtained by two methods: as the difference in self-consistent field (SCF) energies of neutrals and ions (deltaSCF) and as negatives of highest-occupied orbital energies. We found that, except for local spin-density approximation, PZ-SIC worsens DeltaSCF IPs and EAs. On the other hand, PZ-SIC brings orbital eigenvalues into much better agreement with electron removal energies. The Perdew-Zunger SIC seems to over-correct many-electron systems; for molecules it performs worse than for atoms. We also discuss several common approximations to PZ-SIC such as spherical averaging of orbital densities in atoms.},

The total correlation energy is expressed in terms of individual and pair contributions from occupied molecular orbitals, and Gaussian process regression is used to predict these contributions from a feature set that is based on molecular orbital properties, such as Fock, Coulomb, and exchange matrix elements. With the aim of maximizing transferability across chemical systems and compactness of the feature set, we avoid the usual specification of ML features in terms of atom- or geometry-specific information, such atom/element-types, bond-types, or local molecular structure. ML predictions of MP2 and CCSD energies are presented for a range of systems, demonstrating that the method maintains accuracy while providing transferability both within and across chemical families; this includes predictions for molecules with atom-types and elements that are not included in the training set. The method holds promise both in its current form and as a proof-of-principle for the use of ML in the design of generalized density-matrix functionals.}

Here, we test its accuracy in terms of predicting the bandgap of extreme ionic crystals: alkali halides. We found that the WKM can accurately reproduce the alkali halide bandgaps with accuracy in par with the GW method. On the other hand, the hybrid functional with common parameters, which work well for common semiconductors, significantly underestimate the alkali halides.}

  abstract = {The widely used density functional theory (DFT) has a major drawback of underestimating the band gaps of materials. Wannier–Koopmans method (WKM) was recently developed for band gap calculations with accuracy on a par with more complicated methods. WKM has been tested for main group covalent semiconductors, alkali halides, 2D materials, and organic crystals. Here we apply the WKM to another interesting type of material system: the transition metal (TM) oxides. TM oxides can be classified as either with d0 or d10 closed shell occupancy or partially occupied open shell configuration, and the latter is known to be strongly correlated Mott insulators. We found that, while WKM provides adequate band gaps for the d0 and d10 TM oxides, it fails to provide correct band gaps for the group with partially occupied d states. This issue is also found in other mean-field approaches like the GW calculations. We believe that the problem comes from a strong interaction between the occupied and unoccupied d-state Wannier functions in a partially occupied d-state system. We also found that, for pseudopotential calculations including deep core levels, it is necessary to remove the electron densities of these deep core levels in the Hartree and exchange–correlation energy functional when calculating the WKM correction parameters for the d-state Wannier functions.},

In order to put these studies into context, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques.

Accurate prediction of these energies has been rather challenging for ground-state density functional methods, because the commonly adopted density function approximations suffer from delocalization error. In this work, by presuming a quantitative correspondence between the quasiparticle energies and the generalized Kohn–Sham orbital energies, and employing a previously developed global scaling correction approach, we achieve substantially improved prediction of molecular quasiparticle and excitation energies. In addition, we also extend our previous study on temporary anions in resonant states, which are associated with negative molecular electron affinities. The proposed approach does not require any explicit self-consistent field calculation on the excited-state species, and is thus highly efficient and convenient for practical purposes.}

The Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is used with an objective function formulated to reproduce the band structures produced by more accurate hybrid functionals. This approach is demonstrated for transition metal oxides, europium chalcogenides, and narrow-gap semiconductors. The band structures obtained using the BO U values are in agreement with hybrid functional results. Additionally, comparison to the linear response (LR) approach to determining U demonstrates that the BO method is superior.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful quantum mechanical computational tool to perform electronic structure calculations for materials. Few DFT methods can ensure accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. DFT + U + V is an alternative effective approach to overcome this drawback. However, the accuracy sensitively depends on the self-consistent estimation of the high-dimensional onsite and intersite Hubbard interaction U and V terms. We propose Bayesian optimization using a dropout (BOD) algorithm, one type of active learning method, to optimize U and V terms. The DFT + U + V with U/V obtained by BOD can produce improved electronic properties for diverse bulk materials of comparable quality to the hybrid functionals with lower computational cost compared to the linear response approach. Note that the band gaps calculated by BOD are somewhat different from that of hybrid functionals by simply applying the same U/V parameters as in the case of surface slabs and interfaces, which suggests that the transferability of U/V from the bulk models to slabs and interfaces is not as well as expected. BOD is extended to calculate the U/V parameters for slabs and interfaces and reach similar results as bulk solids. Moreover, we find that the U/V are reasonably transferable between surface slabs and interfaces with different thicknesses under various effects of quantum confinement, which contributes to fast access to the electronic properties of large-scale systems with higher accuracy.}

Among the emerging methodologies in this area, we recently proposed an approach to compute optical spectra at finite temperature including phonon-assisted quantum processes via a single supercell calculation [Zacharias and Giustino, Phys. Rev. B 94, 075125 (2016)]. In the present work we considerably expand the scope of our previous theory starting from a compact reciprocal space formulation, and we demonstrate that this improved approach provides accurate temperature-dependent band structures in three-dimensional and two-dimensional materials, using a special set of atomic displacements in a single supercell calculation. We also demonstrate that our special displacement reproduces the thermal ellipsoids obtained from x-ray crystallography and yields accurate thermal averages of the mean-square atomic displacements. This enhanced version of the special displacement method enables nonperturbative, robust, and straightforward ab initio calculations of the electronic and optical properties of solids at finite temperature, and can easily be used as a postprocessing step to any electronic structure code. To illustrate the capabilities of this method, we investigate the temperature-dependent band structures and atomic displacement parameters of prototypical nonpolar and polar semiconductors and of a prototypical two-dimensional semiconductor, namely Si, GaAs, and monolayer MoS2, and we obtain excellent agreement with previous calculations and experiments. Given its simplicity and numerical stability, the present development is suited for high-throughput calculations of band structures, quasiparticle corrections, optical spectra, and transport coefficients at finite temperature.}

In particular, the scaled version of a modified local density approximation predicts band gaps with an accuracy consistent for systems of all sizes, ranging from atoms and molecules to solids.

In this paper, we give a comprehensive review on scaling correction (SC) approaches developed recently for reducing the delocalization error. The global and local SC approaches impose the rigorous Perdew-Parr-Levy-Balduz condition that the total electronic energy should scale linearly between integer electron numbers, on systems involving global and local fractional electron distributions, respectively. After presenting the theoretical background and mathematical formulation of scaling corrections, we demonstrate that they lead to universal alleviation of delocalization error. This is exemplified by the substantial improvement for the prediction of a wide range of electronic properties, including Kohn-Sham frontier orbital energies and band gaps, dissociation behavior of molecules, reaction barriers, electric polarizabilities, and charge-transfer species. The encouraging performances of SC approaches highlight their practicality and usefulness, and also affirm that an explicit treatment of fractional electron distributions is essentially important for reducing the intrinsic delocalization error. The existing limitations, the remaining challenges, and the future perspectives of SC are also discussed. Moreover, the SC approaches are compared with some existing methods attempting to remove the self-interaction error, such as the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction, the local hybrid hyper-generalized gradient approximations, and the rangeseparated density functional approximations. The unique advantages of SC suggest that it could open a novel and potentially paradigm-changing route for advancing density functional theory methods towards chemical accuracy.},
