## Modify Spacing between Boxes
Unfortunately for technical reasons, setting the spacing between boxes generated by `peace-of-posters` has to be done manually with 3 distinct methods.
Suppose, we want to set the new spacing to `0.5em` from the [default value](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-spacing) of `1.2em`.
So let's capture this in a variable.
```typst
#let box-spacing = 0.5em
```
First, we need to specify the spacing between [blocks](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/).
```typst
#set block(spacing: box-spacing)
```
Next, we also want to change the spacing between columns.
Thus we modify the `gutter` argument of the [`columns` function](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/columns/).
```typst
#set columns(gutter: box-spacing)
```
Last but not least, we need to tell `peace-of-posters` to use the new value when calculating how large boxes need to be in order to stretch them to the nearest endpoint.
```typst
#update-poster-layout(
    spacing: box-spacing,
)
```

## Variable width of columns
To create a document with different widths of columns, we can use two instances of a wrapper
[`box`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/box/).
View the output of this code [here](../../examples/variable-width-columns/main.pdf).

```typst
#grid(
    gutter: pop.layout-a4.spacing,
    columns: (2fr, 3fr),
    box(width: 100%)[
        #pop.column-box(heading: "Left Column")[This is a box on the left]
    ],
    box(width: 100%)[
        #pop.column-box(heading: "Right Column")[This is a bit bigger on the right]
    ],
    box(width: 100%)[
        #pop.column-box(heading: "Stretch it", stretch-to-next: true)[
            This stretches all the way to the bottom of the page
        ]
    ],
)
#pop.bottom-box()[At the bottom]
```

## Deeply modify Heading and Body Boxes
In order to deeply modify heading and body boxes, we are able to change the function itself which draws the box.
By default, these boxes are simply rectangles which are drawn with the specified options.
We define a new function that takes the heading as a mandatory argument (or the body when changing the body funtion) and a range of arguments not more closely specified.
```typst
#let my-custom-heading(heading, ..args) = {
    ...
}
```
This function will now obtain all information that the default `rect` function would be given as well.
We can choose to ignore the optional `..args` or reuse them if desired.
Let's begin by simply making a smaller centered box.
```typst
#let my-custom-heading(heading, ..args) = {
    align(center, rect(heading, ..args, width: 100% - 2em))
}
```

Afterwards, we need to supply the new behaviour to `peace-of-posters` by setting the corresponding option in the [layout](/documentation/layout).
```typst
#update-poster-layout(
    heading-box-function: my-custom-heading,
)
```
