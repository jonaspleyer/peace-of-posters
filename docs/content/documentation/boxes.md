# Boxes
Please note that most values which have default values [none] are probably specified either by a [theme](../themes) or [layout](../layouts).
## Common Box
This box is mostly meant as a shared template for other functions to be calling.
While it can be used individually, users should strongly consider relying on other functions.

The `common-box` method creates two rectangles, one for the heading and one for the body of the box.
Both are optional and can be left out.
This box also automatically considers the currently defined [theme](themes) and styles the box accordingly.
```typst
#common-box(
    body: [none] [content],
    heading: [none] [content],
    heading-size: [none] [length],
    heading-box-args: [none] [dictionary],
    heading-text-args: [none] [dictionary],
    body-size: [none] [length],
    body-box-args: [none] [dictionary],
    body-text-args: [none] [dictionary],
    stretch-to-next: [bool],
    spacing: [none] [length] [relative],
    bottom-box: [bool],
) --> [content]
```

| Argument | Type | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `body` | [none] [content] | [none] | The lower rectangle containing the body of the box. |
| `heading` | [none] [content] | [none] | The upper rectangle which defines the heading of the box.
| `heading-box-args` | [none] [dictionary] | [none] | Arguments given to the box-type function that creates the heading. |
| `heading-text-args` | [none] [dictionary] | [none] | Arguments given to the `text` function which creates the heading. |
| `body-size` | [none] [length] | [none] | Size of the body. |
| `body-box-args` | [none] [dictionary] | [none] | Arguments given to the box-type function that creates the body. |
| `body-text-args` | [none] [dictionary] | [none] | Arguments given to the `text` function which creates the body. |
| `stretch-to-next` | [bool] | [false] | The vertical size of the box is stretched such that it fills out the remainder of the vertical space. |
| `spacing` | [none] | [none] | Only useful when specifying `stretch-to-next`. Controls spacing towards next block. |
| `bottom-box` | [bool] | [false] | The box should be aligned towards the bottom of the page. |

<div class="warning-block">
    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>The <code>stretch-to-next</code> should not be used on a block which is already maximal by itself.
    Doing so will most likely result in glitches.
    </p>
</div>

### Example
```typst
#common-box(
    heading: "peace-of-posters - Create scientific posters",
)
```

## Column Box
```typst
#column-box(
    body: [content],
    ..args
) --> [content]
```
All arguments align with `common-box` but the `column-box` requires at least a body.

## Bottom Box
A box that will be placed at the bottom of the page.
It is also possible to specify a logo and text-width of the remaining content.
```typst
#bottom-box(
    body: [content],
    text-relative-width: [relative],
    logo: [none] [content],
    ..args
) --> [content]
```
| Argument | Type | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `body` | [content] | | Body of the bottom box. |
| `text-relative-width` | [relative] | `70%` | Space left of the logo where text can be displayed. |
| `logo` | [none] [content] | [none] | The content which should be used as logo. Usually specified by an [image](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/). It will be aligned towards the right side of the box. |

## Bibliography Box

<div class="warning-block">
